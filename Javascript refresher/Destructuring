//Destructuring is the process of esaily extracting elements from an array elements or objects functions.
//it is different than the spread and rest operator as they take out all elements in an array while the destrcuturing takes out particular elements.

Example : 
const numbers = [1,2,3];
[number1,number2] = numbers;
console.log(number1,number2);   //Output = [1,2]
[number1, , number3] = numbers;
console.log(number1,number2);   //Output = [1,3]
