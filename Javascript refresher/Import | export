//We have two types of import and export in Javascript.
// Default and Named(const)
//Default example  ... file name = person.js
const person = {
  name:'Nikhil'
}
export default person;

//Named export example .. file name = utility.js
export const clean = () =>{...};
export const baseData = 10;


// While importing in another Js file as components we have to call these components.
//file name =  app.js
import person from './person.js';           // Default export.
import prs from './person.js'

import { clean } from './utility.js';       // Named export.
import { baseData } from './utility.js';

//we can't change the name of named export direcly as they are constant/fixed however, when calling them we can specify another name for these components.
import { clean as cle } from './utility.js';
import { baseData as base } from './utility.js';


// To IMPORT EVER COMPONENT FROM A FILE WE DIRECTLY IMPORT * as bundled.
import * as bundled from './utility.js';
